Note App



Note App is a simple, yet powerful app designed to allow users to manage and organize their notes. Built with React, this app allows users to add, delete, and mark notes as complete. Additionally, users can sort their notes by their creation date or completion status.

The Story
The Note App was built to provide an easy way to organize thoughts, ideas, and tasks in a digital format. It allows users to quickly add a note with a title and description, track their progress by marking them as complete, and delete notes when they're no longer needed. The app is fully interactive and provides real-time feedback on user actions.
